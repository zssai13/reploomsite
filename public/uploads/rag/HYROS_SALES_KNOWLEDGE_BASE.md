# HYROS Sales Agent Knowledge Base

## OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### OBJECTION: Tracking links look like affiliate links
**Context:** Prospect wants to track influencer performance but worried UTM links will look like affiliate links to customers
**Response:** HYROS uses cloaked UTMs. The link displays as the clean website URL (e.g., nutriest.eu) but contains hidden tracking parameters. Customers clicking the link cannot see the UTM tracking - it's invisible to them.
**Key phrase:** "We cloak it. It won't be visible. The person clicking can't see that."

---

### OBJECTION: Price is too expensive / revenue slightly exceeds tier
**Context:** Prospect's revenue fluctuates around tier boundaries (e.g., ~100k EUR monthly but 83k tier limit)
**Response:** 
1. Start on the lower tier to save money upfront
2. When revenue exceeds the tier limit, upgrade mid-cycle
3. HYROS prorates the difference - you only pay for the days at the higher tier
4. Tracking doesn't start until HYROS is installed, so current month's revenue before setup doesn't count
**Key phrase:** "We'll prorate the difference. You won't pay the full amount, you'll just pay for the few days that you exceed that revenue."

---

### OBJECTION: No free trial?
**Context:** Prospect asks for a trial period before committing
**Response:** HYROS doesn't offer free trials because full setup is included (which costs money to deliver). Instead, HYROS offers a 90-day money-back guarantee - full refund for any reason within 90 days. This makes it risk-free while still getting proper setup support.
**Key phrase:** "We don't offer a free trial as we set everything up with you. What we do offer is a 90-day guarantee. For any reason you don't like HYROS, you can refund the full amount within 90 days."

---

### OBJECTION: Don't want to pay annually upfront
**Context:** Prospect doesn't have cash flow for annual commitment
**Response:** HYROS offers flexible billing options:
- Month-to-month (full rate)
- Quarterly (saves ~10%)
- Annual (saves ~30%)
Prospect can start monthly, then upgrade to quarterly or annual anytime to get deeper discounts.

---

### OBJECTION: Still too expensive even with tier flexibility
**Context:** Prospect pushes back on cost after tier/proration explanation
**Counter-response technique:** Reframe the cost as an investment question
**Key phrase:** "What is it costing you NOT having accurate data on your ads? Usually what we see is ad platforms are 15-30% off on your ad dollars. If you're spending 7k a month, that's a couple thousand dollars getting misattributed per month."

---

### OBJECTION: Any discounts available?
**Context:** Prospect directly asks for discount
**Response:** Quick Onboarding Promotion - Get onboarded within 5 business days and receive 15% off for the next 2 years. This rewards fast implementation and correlates with higher customer success rates.
**Key phrase:** "If you get onboarded within five business days, we'll knock 15% off for the next two years you're with HYROS."

## TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES

### Influencer/Affiliate Tracking
**Problem:** Tracking influencer performance without using visible discount codes or affiliate links
**Solution:** 
- Create cloaked UTM links for each influencer
- Link displays as clean URL but contains hidden tracking
- Attribute sales using last-click attribution to specific influencers
- Works for Instagram stories, reels, link-in-bio

---

### Server-Side Tracking Advantages
**vs. Platform Tracking:**
- Not dependent on cookies or browser-side UTMs
- Stores customer data on HYROS servers
- No tracking expiration (vs. Google's 90-day window, Facebook's 7-day window)
- Tracks across multiple platforms in one place
- Overcomes iOS privacy restrictions and EU GDPR limitations

**How it works:**
1. HYROS plugs into all ad platforms and checkout/cart system
2. When someone clicks an ad, HYROS captures their data server-side
3. Data stored on HYROS servers permanently
4. Every touchpoint tracked across platforms including purchases

---

### Cross-Platform Attribution
**Capabilities:**
- View Google, Meta, Bing, and organic traffic in one dashboard
- Compare platform-reported revenue vs. HYROS-tracked revenue
- Identify which platforms are over/under-reporting
- See discrepancies (e.g., Google under-reporting $15k, Facebook over-reporting $7k)

---

### Organic/SEO Tracking
**Capabilities:**
- Track Google organic, Bing organic searches
- Attribute sales to organic discovery
- See organic touchpoints in customer journey (before/after paid ads)
**Limitation:** Cannot capture specific keyword searches (Google doesn't provide this data)

---

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

### Technical Stack
- "What platform are you on?" (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)
- "What ad platforms are you running?" (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.)
- "What's your payment processor?" (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

### Pain Point Discovery
- "How's the ad manager looking? Is it under-reporting or over-reporting?"
- "How do you know your data is inaccurate?"
- "What's the data look like versus your actual purchases?"

### Sizing/Qualification
- "What do you spend on ads per month?"
- "What are you on track to do this month for revenue?"
- "Do you have a team that does media buying or do you do everything yourself?"

### Influencer-Specific
- "When influencers post, is there a call to action to check out the product?"
- "Do they have a link in bio or just stories?"

## VALUE PROPOSITIONS BY USE CASE

### For E-commerce with Multiple Ad Platforms
"You'll be able to see accurate attribution across all platforms in one place. These ad platforms misreport data - even with conversion API setup properly. HYROS shows which ads are actually resulting in sales."

### For Companies Concerned About Privacy/iOS Impact
"With server-side tracking, we're not using cookies or UTMs to track. We grab their data and store it on our servers. There's no expiration of tracking."

### For Influencer Marketing
"We can add a cloaked UTM to any influencer link. It shows your clean website URL, but we can attribute sales to that specific influencer with last-click attribution."

### For SEO-Focused Companies
"We can attribute to Google organic, Bing organic - you'll see when they search organically, then click an ad after, and give you proper attribution to the organic platform."
